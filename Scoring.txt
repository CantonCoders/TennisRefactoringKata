Scoring
You need to score four points to win a game of 
tennis. The points are known as 15 (1 point), 
30 (two points), 40 (three points) and the 
fourth would result in the winning point and 
the end of that game. If the scores went to 
40-40 this would be known as deuce. When a 
game reaches deuce the player must then win 
by two clear points.

Winning the Game
To win the game you must win a certain amount 
of sets (best of three for women’s matches and 
best of 5 sets for men’s matches). Winning a 
set is simply the first player to reach 6 games 
but have to be clear by at least 2 games. If 
your opponent wins 5 games you must win the set 
7-5. If the set goes to 6-6 then a tie break is 
played and it’s simply the first player to 7 points.
